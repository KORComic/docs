## Security Measures

The project has known moderate severity vulnerabilities in webpack-dev-server (a
dependency of Docusaurus). Important notes:

1. These vulnerabilities **only affect development environments**, not
   production builds
2. The vulnerabilities could potentially allow source code exposure when using
   the dev server
3. Production builds and deployments are **not affected** by these
   vulnerabilities
